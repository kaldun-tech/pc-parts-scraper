# PC Parts Price Tracker

A serverless application that tracks PC component prices from various retailers and sends notifications through Discord when prices change or items become available.

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated price tracking using AWS Lambda
- üìä Price history storage in DynamoDB
- üîî Real-time Discord notifications
- ‚ö° Serverless architecture for scalability
- üõçÔ∏è Multi-retailer support (currently Canada Computers)

## Setup

1. Install prerequisites:
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already
# Then install AWS CDK CLI globally
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaldun-tech/pc-parts-scraper.git
cd pc-parts-scraper
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r lambda\requirements.txt
playwright install  # Install browser binaries for web scraping
```

4. Configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash
# Discord webhook URL for notifications
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url

# AWS configuration
# Option 1: Use AWS CLI profile (recommended)
AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name  # Or use --profile with cdk commands

# Option 2: Direct credentials (not recommended, use AWS profiles instead)
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
# AWS_REGION=your_preferred_region
```

The environment variables are loaded using python-dotenv in both the CDK stack and Lambda function. The Discord webhook URL is automatically stored in AWS Parameter Store during deployment, and the Lambda function is granted permission to access it.

Note: You don't need to set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_ARN` - this is automatically handled by the CDK stack.

5. Deploy with CDK:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

## Running Tests

Run tests using pytest:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/                    # Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_handler.py  # Run specific test
python -m pytest -v tests/                 # Verbose output
```

Note: Tests use mocked AWS and Discord dependencies.

## Development

- Python code is formatted using Black
- All new code must include type hints
- Tests are located in the `tests` directory
- Lambda function code is in the `lambda` directory
- CDK infrastructure code is in `pc_parts_scraper`
