# PC Parts Price Tracker

A serverless application that tracks PC component prices from various retailers and sends notifications through Discord when prices change or items become available.

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated price tracking using AWS Lambda
- üìä Price history storage in DynamoDB
- üîî Real-time Discord notifications
- ‚ö° Serverless architecture for scalability
- üõçÔ∏è Multi-retailer support (currently Canada Computers)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaldun-tech/pc-parts-scraper.git
cd pc-parts-scraper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r lambda\requirements.txt
playwright install  # Install browser binaries for web scraping
```

3. Configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash
# Discord webhook URL for notifications
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url

# AWS configuration (choose one option):
# Option 1: Use AWS CLI profile (recommended)
AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name  # Defaults to 'default' if not set

# Option 2: Direct credentials (if not using AWS CLI profile)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_preferred_region
```

The environment variables are loaded using python-dotenv in both the CDK stack and Lambda function. The Discord webhook URL is automatically stored in AWS Parameter Store during deployment, and the Lambda function is granted permission to access it.

Note: You don't need to set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_ARN` - this is automatically handled by the CDK stack.

4. Deploy with CDK:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

## Development
